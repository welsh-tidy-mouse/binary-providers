This repository provides a set of binary providers for use with the [Binary Fetcher](https://github.com/welsh-tidy-mouse/binary-fetcher) library.

Each binary provider defines how to locate and download a specific binary from GitHub releases, tailored to the current platform (OS + architecture). These providers are used by Binary Fetcher to automate the installation of CLI tools across environments.

## üì¶ What Is This For?

The [`binary-fetcher`](https://github.com/welsh-tidy-mouse/binary-fetcher) project is a PHP-based tool to download platform-specific binaries with zero configuration. It can be used both:
- **Via CLI** (`bin/binary-fetcher download`)
- **Via PHP** (`BinaryFetcher::download()`)

This repository (`binary-providers`) contains the list of supported binaries through reusable PHP provider classes.

## üöÄ How to Use These Providers

Using [Binary Fetcher](https://github.com/welsh-tidy-mouse/binary-fetcher), you can download any of these binaries based on your current OS and architecture.

### From CLI

```bash
bin/binary-fetcher download "\WelshTidyMouse\BinaryProvider\BunJsBinaryProvider"
```

### From PHP

```php
use WelshTidyMouse\BinaryFetcher\BinaryFetcher;
use WelshTidyMouse\BinaryProvider\BunJsBinaryProvider;

$binaryPath = (new BinaryFetcher())->download(BunJsBinaryProvider::class);
```

The binary will be downloaded to a writable location and its path will be returned.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Contributions

You can add your own binary provider class implementing the interface:

```php
namespace WelshTidyMouse\BinaryFetcher\Contract;

use WelshTidyMouse\BinaryFetcher\Exception\BinaryProviderException;
use WelshTidyMouse\BinaryFetcher\Type\OsType;
use WelshTidyMouse\BinaryFetcher\Type\SystemArchType;

interface BinaryProviderInterface
{
    public function __construct();
    public function getName(): string;
    public function getDownloadableAssetUrl(string $version, OsType $os, SystemArchType $arch): ?string;
    public function getBinaryFilenameFromDownloadedAsset(string $assetFileName, string $downloadDirPath): string;
}
```

Pull requests for additional binary providers are welcome!
